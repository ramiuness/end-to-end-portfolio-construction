# End-to-End Portfolio Construction
	
End-to-end portfolio optimization systems leverage a fully data-driven pipeline to improve investment decision-making. These systems learn to forecast expected returns in a way that directly supports portfolio allocation, integrating predictive modeling and optimization into a unified process. Rather than treating forecasting and optimization separately, the model learns what matters most for downstream performance.

Key features of the approach include:

- Flexibility in defining portfolio objectives, allowing alignment with different investment mandates.

- Data-driven calibration of risk preferences to better reflect market conditions.

- Can be tailored to the uncertainty in the distribution of mean returns, thus providing robustness against model missepcification.

- Built-in backtesting workflows that assess how portfolio decisions perform under real-world market dynamics.

- Substantial performance gains over traditional approaches, including significantly higher Sharpe ratios compared to standard predict-then-optimize methods.

This framework exemplifies modern quantitative investing‚Äîwhere machine learning and optimization are tightly coupled to drive better portfolio outcomes.

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that illustrates my extension of the models and code for the paper "Distributionally Robust Portfolio Construction", [Journal of Financial Econometrics, 2023](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14697688.2023.2236148).

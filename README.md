# End-to-End Portfolio Construction
	
 End-to-end portfolio construction systems are full-cycle, entirely data-driven, portfolio optimization systems. These systems employ the decision-focused learning paradigm to address the estimation problem of the mean returns. The "smart-predict-then-optimize" learning of mean returns from financial factors is integrated into the decision layer of the system, and is learned to directly support downstream allocation decisions. The systems illustrated here:
 
- Allow flexibility on the objective function of the decision layer
- Allow learning the risk aversion parameter from the data
- Incorporate robust backtesting workflows to evaluate the decision impact of learned models under realistic market dynamics
- Demonstrate a significant inrease on the Sharpe ratio as compared to the "naive" predict-then-optimize porfolios.
